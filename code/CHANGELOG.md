## [2.0.0] - 2018-10-12
#### Added
- Audit command. Runs an `npm audit` across all modules.

#### Changed
- Swapped out `yarn` commands to use `npm` now that NPM is as fast as yarn
  Effected commands:
  - `delete`
  - `publish`

## [1.11.0] - 2018-07-16
#### Added
- `typescript` (`ts`) comment for changing values in tsconfig.json files.
  Initial option used to flip the `noUnusedLocals` switch.

## [1.10.0] - 2018-07-9
#### Added
- `msync outdated` runs an `npm outdated` command on each module.
- `msync deleted` deletes transient files across projects (such as logs, yarn.lock, node_modules etc).

## [1.8.2] - 2018-03-31
#### Changed
- Write `__msync.js` to target typescript lib to force `nodemon` to restart.
- Updated Typescript versions (referencing @tdb libs)

## [1.7.0] - 2017-06-08
#### Changed
- `build` command running concurrently and syncing modules after each build.

## [1.6.0] - 2017-05-13
#### Added
- Full install and sync for `msync publish` using the `-f` flag.
  The option is slower but ensures all modules references, including changes to external module references, are consistent and correct. It is included as a flag because it is slower, and when publishing fast (without the flag) it is assumed that all internal modules have been synced and that dependencies are working.

#### Added
